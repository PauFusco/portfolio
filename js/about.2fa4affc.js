This design pattern let me\n      tightly control the flow of the behaviour of the player, defining what made them move or jump, and the transitions between states.\n      <br/>\n      The model of the state machine was taken from my End of Degree project, where each state is defined separately using a base <strong>state</strong> class, and\n      each state later tells the <strong>state machine</strong> to which state they transition and when they do it. This also had to be adapted to the Godot environment,\n      since this editor does not let us put multiple scripts in a single <strong>Node</strong>.\n      <br/>\n      The result is the player Node having a <strong>State Machine</strong> child Node, that controls the flow of its <strong>State</strong> children,\n      better seen in the following image.\n     \n      <div class="paragraph center">\n      <img class="photo" src="img/projects/whoami-player_hierarchy.png" alt="player hierarchy" />\n      </div>\n\n      This results in very simple code when looked individually, since this is compartimented in different scripts. Initially there were not enough states\n      to consider developing a state machine, but as the hours progressed, the player script kept increasing in size and complexity. Finite State Machines solve\n      clarity and responsability of code, trading for ease of understanding because of the need of looking into multiple scripts to understand the full picture.\n\n      <div class="paragraph center">\n      <img class="photo" src="img/projects/whoami-state_machine.png" alt="player state machine" />\n      </div>\n\n      As a small detail, you can also see that in the hierarchy screenshot, the camera is a child of the <strong>head</strong> Node instead of being directly put\n      in the player. This is due to having the head control the pitch of the camera, and the body control the yaw of the player altogether.\n      This was preemptive in the case there was time to change the model to show the current equipped mask, giving a more realistic look when looking around.\n      \n      <div class="paragraph center">\n      <img class="photo" src="img/projects/whoami-yawrot.png" alt="player rotation" />\n      <img class="photo" src="img/projects/whoami-pitchrot.png" alt="head rotation" />\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n    ',"#c1a506",!1,!1),new r["a"]("pc-gmtk","Primal Cycle","img/projects/primalcycle.png",'\n    <div class="paragraph">\n      <strong>Advance</strong> through rooms, <strong>defeat</strong> the boss, <strong>break</strong> the cycle.

The chance of spawning a specific enemy is also random, set by a chance, making the system highly customizable.\n      <br />\n      As the game progresses, rooms increase the available credits, increasing the amount of enemies that spawn.
