      <h4>Barcelona, 2023</h4>

        The main task I performed was to take old devices, analyze their components and see which ones
        could be used to make new ones that performed better, extending their useful life.

        I also was in charge of helping my colleages with any techical problem they encounter, from checking
        their laptops for any issue to migrating their data to their new devices.
